                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>I am an aspiring developer from Dayton, OH.  A tinkerer and breaker at heart.  
                        A builder, maker and dreamer by nature.  I love everything tech, and am always 
                        coding <em>something</em>.  I am currently attending Memphis Launch Code 2019 
                        after leaving a few semesters of Software Development in Ohio.  I am proficient
                        in Python 3 and C++.  I am currently seeking my first developer position, having 
                        the foundational experience to solve most any problem. As well as the gumption 
                        to know when it is time to ask for assistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have spent the past 4 years studying software development on my own with one year
                    of that time spent at Sinclair Community College in Dayton, OH working on an AAS in
                    Software Development.  My family and I have moved several states, leaving SCC and 
                    formal studies behind.  We have settled in Memphis, TN where I am attending Launch 
                    Code Memphis Winter 2019.  I am currently seeking enrollment at SouthWest Tennessee 
                    Community College for Software Development.
                    </p>
                    <p>I have meandered the world not knowing what I wanted to do with myself, 
                    always refusing to accept what standard may be issued to me throughout indoctrination.
                    It wasn't until several years ago when I found a book at my local library on Basic.  I 
                    took the book home and installed the language on our family computer and was captivated.
                    Now, I couldn't tell you a lick of syntax.  Rather, it was the feeling I got when I
                    started in the coding world.   
                    </p>
                    <p>Four plus years ago, after spending hobby time as an advanced home brewer, a local musician,
                    and a local tube amp builder came the Raspberry Pi.  Along with it, came back my spark for
                    Computer Science.  I have dedicated every bit of free time over the last several years to
                    obtaining in-depth knowledge of the software development cycle(s), problem solving, languages 
                    and coding everything.  It is good to feel meaning and purpose from something.  I only wish
                    I had discovered it sooner, now (for some time) knowing in my heart where I need to be.  Now
                        I just need to land fruitful work in this profession.

                <p>I tend to favor more toward system control, controller, embedded sys, back-end type 
                    development vs web/front-end, but am steadily gaining ground with Javascript (and HTML/CSS).  
                    Although, any sort of code slinging makes me smile.

                <p>LottoGen (currently) runs from CLI on Linux, and provides winning lottery numbers based on the last
                    180 drawings.  Written in C++ (currently developing GUI and updating codebase).  I am researching
                    whether or not to use Qt or VB. There are a few caveats as it stands.

                <h4>install_opencv_ubuntu18</h4>
                <p>Bash shell script to install OpenCV on Linux.  Written by another, placed in an executable
                   script by me.  I needed OpenCV installed on a Linux machine as I was writing a gardening 
                   system for the Raspberry Pi in C++, that would fetch pertinent weather data, parse the data 
                   then automatically actuate water valve solenoids (via GPIO) based n what the user initially 
                   schedules in combination with the fetched weather data.  The idea is to use the Rpi Zero W 
                   (with only 20 GPIO pins)as a sort of embedded stand alone system encased in water tight enclosures.  The expanding 
                   of the GPIO pins from 20 to 40 (if even needed) come from desigining a circuit that holds
                   two MCP3008 chipsets adding 16 pins reading analogue signals.  This trade off will reduce
                   the cost of digital sensors for cheaper analogue sensors, given the chipsets are just under
                   $2 a piece and the cost to build the resulting pcb mere pennies.

                <h3>Adventures in Linux</h3>
                <p>There's no doubt about it, Linux makes my heart beat.  Sometime's rather too much until we 
                    find a "workaround".  There is something about the OS that has always caight my attention.
                I am not saying that MacOS or WinOS are inferior in anyway, rather each having their own
                place in the computing world.  If you think about it, Windows is the only real odd ball here.
                MacOS is a based on Unix just as Linux is.  Linux/Unix commands work the same on MacOS.  This
                leaves WinOS the odd one of the group.  Nonetheless, I adore each of them.<br>
                My first run in with Linux was the Debian flavor, from there came Ubuntu then Ubuntu-Mate.  I just
                enjoy the stripped down version of Ubuntu.  Initially, it is light-weight but by the time I am development
                with it it is usually a few gigabits heavier.  Absolutely customized to my workflow and nothing else.  I 
                typically have a machine that dual boots WinOS and Ubuntu-Mate.<br>
                One of these days, I will win the lottery or sell a kidney and get to pickup one of those wicked awesome
                MacBook Pro's.  <strong>Better yet!</strong>  I could get hired by a great employer looking for an
                entry level/junior developer, that supplies MacBook Pro's to their employees.  Fingers crossed Freddy.</p>
