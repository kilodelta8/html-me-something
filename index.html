                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>I am an aspiring developer from Dayton, OH.  A tinkerer and breaker at heart.  
                    A builder, maker and dreamer by nature.  I love everything tech, and am always 
                    coding <em>something</em>.  I am currently attending Memphis Launch Code 2019 
                    after leaving a few semesters of Software Development in Ohio.  I am proficient
                    in Python 3 and C++.  I am currently <strong>desperately</strong> seeking my first 
                    developer position, having the foundational experience to solve most any problem.
                    As well as the gumption to know when it is time to ask for assistance.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I also enjoy::</p>

                <p>I tend to favor more toward system control, controller, embedded sys, back-end type 
                    development vs web/front-end.  Although, any sort of code slinging makes me smile.

                <h3>Adventures in Linux</h3>
                <p>There's no doubt about it, Linux makes my heart beat.  Sometime's rather too much until we 
                    find a "workaround".  There is something about the OS that has always caight my attention.
                I am not saying that MacOS or WinOS are inferior in anyway, rather each having their own
                place in the computing world.  If you think about it, Windows is the only real odd ball here.
                MacOS is a based on Unix just as Linux is.  Linux/Unix commands work the same on MacOS.  This
                leaves WinOS the odd one of the group.  Nonetheless, I adore each of them.<br>
                My first run in with Linux was the Debian flavor, from there came Ubuntu then Ubuntu-Mate.  I just
                enjoy the stripped down version of Ubuntu.  Initially, it is light-weight but by the time I am development
                with it it is usually a few gigabits heavier.  Absolutely customized to my workflow and nothing else.  I 
                typically have a machine that dual boots WinOS and Ubuntu-Mate.<br>
                One of these days, I will win the lottery or sell a kidney and get to pickup one of those wicked awesome
                MacBook Pro's.  <strong>Better yet!</strong>  I could get hired by a great employer looking for an
                entry level/junior developer, that supplies MacBook Pro's to their employees.  Fingers crossed Freddy.</p>
